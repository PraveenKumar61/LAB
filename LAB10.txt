Q. Create a base class called vehicle with the following methods *viod start() this method should print "vehicle started" .
create two subclases of vehicle called car and motorcycle. override the start() method in each subclass to provide a specific
implementation:
*car print"car started".
*motorcycle:print "motorcycle started".
create a class called Garage with a method named serviceVehicle(Vehicle vehicle) inside this method.call the start()
method of the provided vehicle onject and print"Vehicle Serviced". 
in the main class,create instance of car and motorcycle create are instance of Garage class.
call the serviceVehicle() method of Garage class  with instance of both car and motorcycle.


class Vehicle {
  void start(){
    System.out.println("vehicle started");
  }
}
class Car extends Vehicle {
  void start() {
    System.out.println("car started");
  }
}
class MotorCycle extends Vehicle {
  void start() {
    System.out.println("motor cycle started");
  }
}
class Garage {
  void ServiceVehicle(Vehicle vehicle){
    vehicle.start();
    System.out.println("vehicle serviced");
  }
}
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car c = new Car();
    MotorCycle m = new MotorCycle();
    Garage g = new Garage();
    g.ServiceVehicle(c);
    g.ServiceVehicle(m);
  }
}
Output:

car started
vehicle serviced
motor cycle started
vehicle serviced
